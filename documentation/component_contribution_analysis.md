### Overview

This Jupyter Notebook evaluates the contribution of individual components in a generative model to the predictive performance of microbial abundance data. The analysis is based on the results generated by `component_contribution_fit.py` for various component-excluded models and initialization seeds.

---

### **Purpose**
The notebook:
1. Aggregates and analyzes results from component-excluded generative models.
2. Compares the performance of the full model (`mtype = 0`) against models with specific components excluded (`mtype = 1–5`).
3. Quantifies the contribution of each component to the model’s predictive performance, using metrics such as the **Log-Likelihood Predictive Density (LLPD)**.

---

### **Inputs**
The notebook processes output files generated by `component_contribution_fit.py`, which are stored in a results directory.

1. **Input Directory:**
   - Results are loaded from `../results/component/models/`.
   - File naming convention: `"{uid}_{mtype}_{m_seed}_model_nb_cvtest.pkl"`.
   - Each file corresponds to a unique combination of:
     - **`uid`**: Simulation setting identifier.
     - **`mtype`**: Component-exclusion model type.
     - **`m_seed`**: Initialization seed.

2. **Data Extracted from Files:**
   - **LLPD**: Log-likelihood predictive density for holdout data.
   - **Other Metrics**: Validation log-likelihood and predicted values.

---

### **Workflow**

1. **Load Results:**
   - Reads `.pkl` files from the results directory.
   - Extracts key metrics (e.g., LLPD) for each combination of `mtype` and `m_seed`.

2. **Data Aggregation:**
   - Combines data across multiple initialization seeds for statistical analysis.
   - Groups results by `mtype` to compute:
     - Mean LLPD across seeds.
     - Standard deviation of LLPD to quantify variability.

3. **Compare Component Contributions:**
   - Evaluates the impact of excluding each component (`mtype = 1–5`) by comparing its LLPD to the full model (`mtype = 0`).
   - Quantifies the performance drop when a component is excluded.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Generates visualizations to compare LLPD across models:
     - **Bar Charts**: Highlight mean LLPD for each `mtype`.
     - **Scatter Plots**: Show variability in LLPD across seeds.
     - **Parallel Coordinates (if used)**: Illustrate relationships between hyperparameters and metrics.

5. **Output Summary:**
   - Identifies the most critical components based on the largest performance drop when excluded.
   - Provides insights into component contributions for model interpretation.

### **Outputs**

1. **Summary Results:**
   - Aggregated mean and standard deviation of LLPD for each `mtype`.
   - Performance drop for each excluded component.

2. **Visualizations:**
   - Comparison of LLPD across `mtype` values.
   - Variability in LLPD across seeds for each model.

3. **Exported File:**
   - CSV file: `../results/component/contribution_summary.csv`.
